package basics.access;

public class Test8 {

    /*

    class M {}
    ________ class N {}

    Following options are available to fill the above blank:
    1. public
    2. private
    3. protected
    4. final
    5. abstract

     How many above options can be used to fill above blank (separately and not together) such that there is no compilation error?

    Only 2 options

     Explanation
        Top-level class can use only two access modifiers [public and default(don't specify anything)]. private and protected cannot be used.
        As file name is M.java, hence class N cannot be public.
        Top-level class can be final, hence it is a correct option.
        Top-level class can be abstract and hence it is also a correct option.
