    And the commands:

    javac Test.java
    java Test "James Gosling" "Bill Joy"

    What is the result?

    Explanation

        Please note, if passed command line arguments contain space(s) in between, then it is a common practice to enclosed within double quotes.
        In this case "James Gosling" is passed as one String object and "Bill Joy" is also passed as one String object.

        java Test "James Gosling" "Bill Joy" passes new String [] {"James Gosling", "Bill Joy"} to args of main method. args[0] refers to "James Gosling" and args[1] refers to "Bill Joy".
        Hence, Welcome James Gosling! is printed on to the console.
        While printing the String object, enclosing quotes are not shown.

        To use quotes as part of the String, you can escape those using backslash, such as:

        java Test "\"James Gosling"\" "\"Bill Joy"\"

        Above command will print Welcome "James Gosling"! on to the console.

public class Test12 {
    public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println("Welcome " + args[0] +"!"); }
}
